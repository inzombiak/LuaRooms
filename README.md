# LuaRooms (WIP)
Multi-user text adventure game. I started this project when I started working on [LuaWrapper](https://github.com/inzombiak/LuaWrapper).
The idea was to create a game mostly controlled with Lua scripts that could be written by Average Joe. 
The game would function like a maze and players could download it, play it and add rooms/items/puzzles etc., then share with friends.

I tried to make the scripting as simple as possible, but there is some room to improve.

## TODO
* Add items
* Add ways to interact with players inventory
* Add more things to do
